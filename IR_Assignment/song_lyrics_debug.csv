ABBA,What About Livingstone,/a/abba/what+about+livingstone_20003055.html,"Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand  
And then I heard them laugh and say  
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
Hey, what's it good for anyway?  
So I said  
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
  
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
Didn't know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him, that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way  
And if you laugh at them  
Then there's only a thing I can say  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Traveling up the Nile  
(Didn't he do it?)  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
(Didn't that help them? Well, didn't it?)  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?

ABBA,When All Is Said And Done,/a/abba/when+all+is+said+done_20003009.html,"Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill  
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill  
Birds of passage, you and me  
We fly instinctively  
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
We're still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor  
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
Clear-headed and open-eyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done  
  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

ABBA,When I Kissed The Teacher,/a/abba/when+i+kissed+the+teacher_20002628.html,"Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher  
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher  
All my friends at school  
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
When I kissed the teacher  
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher  
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher  
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher  
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)
